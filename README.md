## Setup

WEBHOOK_INTEGRATION_SECRET=VAn**********************

# Get this from the Discord UI when setting up a destination webhook
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/**************/39NQ**************************************************************

# Optional: To include build logs in Discord for failed deployments
# Create token at https://vercel.com/account/tokens

```



## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To run locally:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then expose it on the internet via your favourite port-forwarding tool (ngrok, or vs code port forwarding etc...).

Make sure you've set up the appropriate env vars as per setup instructions above.
